 <h6>homepage</h6> <p>While some of the form fields don't explicitly use the autocomplete attribute, they use the aria-label attribute to identify an input field's purpose.</p>
<h6>checkout page</h6> <p>The key issue is the lack of the autocomplete attribute or the use of autocomplete="off" to explicitly identify or turn off the input purpose.Although there are not many form fields on this page, the promo code form field is missing the autocomplete attribute.</p>
<h6>product page</h6> <p>The &lt;input&gt; element has a name attribute with the value "nickName", which suggests that this input field is for entering a nickname or username. However, this purpose is not explicitly identified using the recommended techniques.
The autocomplete attribute is missing from the &lt;input&gt; element, which means the purpose of the input field is not explicitly stated.
This check is also inconsistent on the website since some fields such as the search query has the autocomplete attribute while other fields like the reviews, and email fields do not.</p>

 <h6>homepage</h6> <p>After a user presses a Search button, the page content does not update to include the search results. The screen reader does not read how many searches were returned. Moreover, the VoiceOver is flawed and does not read the new page. "Increment or decrement number" plays repeatedly more than 5 times and there is no way to navigate out of that without turning off screen reader. After a user enters incorrect text in an input field, it does not let you submit what you put in but also will not announce that you put in an incorrect text.</p>
<h6>checkout page</h6> <p>Does not announce status messages such as when user is checking out or presses other buttons or fills in incorrect text in input fields.</p>
